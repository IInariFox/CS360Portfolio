# The developed application is an inventory tracker designed to verify the identity of an end user through a password and user ID, guaranteeing that only authorized modifications occur. Once the user signs in, the application allows for the addition, removal, increase, and decrease of items in a database. Additionally, the app features a radio button on the settings menu, enabling it to send an alert to the user when the stock level becomes low. The inventory is displayed in a grid view, ensuring organized accessibility.
# The application employs four distinct screens: a login screen, a grid view display of the inventory, a settings and notification screen, and an add items flow. With the user experience as a priority during UI development, these screens incorporate a diverse range of brown and gold shades, adhering to a consistent theme. The seamless transition between screens ensures a clear and intuitive navigation.
# The inventory app can be interpreted in many different kinds of ways, there needs to be some kind of feature or UI/front-end thing that sticks out or does better than the industry standard like Excel, QuickBooks, etc. Since a precedent is set, it is not the most difficult to know who the target audience is and develop around or for that, depending don't the niche of the app. However, what is difficult is if it's a new kind of technology, idea, or app. That's where it becomes all research and development based on that research and testing. 
# In order to ensure the functionality and performance of my code, I conducted testing on various emulated devices within the Android IDK. These devices included different screen sizes, such as various Pixel devices and tablets. This step holds significance because while the developer may have a specific device in mind during application development, it is essential to consider that end users may utilize the application on a wide range of different devices in practice.
# After finishing project three, I think the most important thing I learned throughout this class was managing and maneuvering the directory. At the beginning of the course, I struggled with maneuvering throughout each projects directory, and as the weeks went on with adding more files and folders to the project, it got more dense with information, so remembering not only where everything was at, but also what each file did/its significance was hard difficult at first, but has gotten much easier to understand and is also an applicable experience for projects from other classes as well.
